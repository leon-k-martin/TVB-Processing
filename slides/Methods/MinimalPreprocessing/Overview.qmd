-  T1w and T2w images are processed through the same steps in parallel up until cross-modal registration.
-  A field map is used to remove readout distortion in the T1w and T2w images, which slightly improves their alignment and the resulting myelin maps.
-  Bias Field Correction: $\sqrt{T1w * T2w}$
