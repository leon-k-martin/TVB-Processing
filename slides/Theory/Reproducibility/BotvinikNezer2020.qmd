- Previous studies with the mixed gambles task suggested that activity in the **ventromedial prefrontal cortex** and **ventral striatum** (and other) is related to the magnitude of the potential gain.
- 9 Predefined Hypotheses
  - Each hypothesis predicted fMRI activations in a specific brain region, in relation to a specific aspect of the task (gain or loss amount) and a specific group.
  - analysis teams were instructed to report their results on the basis of a whole-brain analysis

- **Need for validation and sharing of complex image processing workflows!!**

*Figure2*: Investigates statistical variability across 64 different research teams.

**Part A:**

- Spearman correlations calculated between team's whole-brain maps.
- Maps clustered based on similarity (Ward clustering on Euclidean distances).
Color coding:
- Row colors indicate cluster membership (Purple for Cluster 1, Blue for Cluster 2, Grey for Cluster 3).
- Column colors represent hypothesis decisions (Green for "yes", Red for "no").

**Part B:**

- Shows average statistical maps for each cluster, thresholded at uncorrected z > 2.0.
- Displays probability of reporting a positive outcome (P_yes) for each cluster.
- Notes: Maps for Hypothesis 1 and 3 are identical, only differing in the brain regions analyzed.

**Key Takeaway:**

- Highlights significant variability in data interpretation among different research teams.
- Emphasizes the need for standardized methods in neuroimaging analysis.
