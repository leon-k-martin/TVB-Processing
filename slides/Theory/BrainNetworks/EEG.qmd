V: Voltages on the scalp
L: Leadfield matrix
J: Currents in the source

- **Source Localization**: Based on the anatomical model of a subject's cortical surface.
- **Sensor Registration**: Registering sensor locations to the source space.
- **Lead-Field Matrix Computation**: Using a sphere-head model fit to meshes representing:
  - Boundaries between cortical surface and skull.
  - Boundaries between skull and skin.
  - Boundaries between skin and air.
- **Customization**: Head model and gain matrix customized to each subject's anatomy.

**Inverse Problem:**

- In EEG source localization, the inverse problem involves estimating the distribution of neural sources J from the measured scalp potentials V.
- Considered ill-posed because no unique solution.
- Many different source configurations can produce similar scalp potentials.
- small errors in the measurements can lead to large errors in the estimated sources.
