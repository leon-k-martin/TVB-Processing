**Schirner2023**
- **Tuning curves for a reduced model (two nodes)**:
  - Identical to the 379-nodes BNM.
  - FC (correlation) between the two nodes increased smoothly and monotonically as a function of their E/I-ratio.
  - The relationship between E/I-ratio and FC persisted when:
    - **Noise strength** (upper panel; Eqs. 5 and 6) was modulated.
    - **Structural coupling strength** (lower panel; Eqs. 1 and 2) was modulated.
  - Both parameters are fixed during the fitting of the full 379-nodes model.

- **Fitting results for the full 379-nodes model**:
  - One exemplary FC.
  - **Empirical FC**: Upper triangular portion of the matrix.
  - **Simulated FC**: Lower triangular portion of the matrix.
  - **Joint distributions**:
    - Without E/I-tuning (upper panel).
    - With E/I-tuning (lower panel).

- **Pearson correlations and RMSEs between empirical and simulated FCs**:
  - **Three model variants**:
    - EI-tuning: Tuning algorithm applied on both E and I.
    - E-tuning: Tuning algorithm applied only on E.
    - Original: Tuning of a scalar global coupling scaling factor to rescale.
  - N = 650 empirical and simulated FCs.
