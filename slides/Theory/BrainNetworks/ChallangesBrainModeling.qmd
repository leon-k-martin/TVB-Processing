**Goal of neuroimaging**: Elucidate brain function in relation to its multiple layers of organization that operate at different spatial and temporal scales

:::{.callout-warning}
1. Challenging integration across spatiotemporal scales [@Akil2011]
2. Limited reproducibility of imaging studies [@BotvinikNezer2020]
3. Reproducible brain imaging studies require huge sample sizes [@Marek2022]
:::

↳ Brain network models help understanding multi-scale brain dynamics by integrating individual **structural** and **functional** data with neural population models [@Schirner2018].

- **Figure1**
  - Construction: Derived from diffusion-weighted MRI tractography and anatomical MRI region parcellations.
  - Node Injection: Nodes receive subject-specific EEG source activity time series instead of noise.
  - fMRI Prediction: Predicted fMRI time series are matched to each subject’s empirical fMRI data, acquired simultaneously with EEG.
  - Network Structure:
    - Local Networks: Comprise excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neural population models driven by EEG source activity (red arrows).
    - Global Coupling: Nodes are connected by structural connectomes (green arrows), representing white matter coupling strengths.
  - Analysis:
    - Synaptic Input Currents (Equations 1 and 2)
    - Firing Rates (Equations 3 and 4)
    - Synaptic Activity (Equations 5 and 6)
  - Purpose: To relate neural population activity and network interactions to observable neuroimaging signals.
  - Visualization: See Video 1 for a brain network model construction and simulation results.

  a) Neuron firing decreases during peaks of α-waves and increases during troughs (Haegens et al., 2011).
  b) Simulations show an inverse relationship between neuron firing and α-phase due to neural excitation and inhibition balance (Atallah and Scanziani, 2009).
  c) On a longer timescale (<0.25 Hz), firing rates oscillate inversely to α-band power (Haegens et al., 2011).
  d) Model simulations link α-band power oscillations to fMRI oscillations, predicting resting-state fMRI time series and spatial patterns (de Munck et al., 2008).
  e) Scale-free fMRI power spectra emerge from long-range network input (He, 2011).
  f) Functional connectivity matrices were predicted over varying time windows (Allen et al., 2014).
