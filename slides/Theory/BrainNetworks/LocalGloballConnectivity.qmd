**Spatial Scales of Structural Connectivity**

- **Human Cortex Representation**
  - Depicted as a triangular mesh (lower panel).

- **Local Connections**
  - Represented with a kernel function, $W_{\xi}(z)$, of the exponential family.
  - Associated with intracortical fibers.

- **Anatomical Parcellation**
  - Cortex divided into a finite number of patches (upper right).

- **Connectome**
  - Connections between parcels represented as Uv = 2.

- **Time-Delays**
  - Introduced via long-range connections {$u_{jk}$, $\tau_{jk}$}.
